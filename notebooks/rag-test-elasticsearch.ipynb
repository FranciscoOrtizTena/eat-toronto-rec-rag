Guests rave about the perfect over-easy eggs, delectable home fries, and succulent sausage, all complemented by some of the best pancakes they’ve ever tasted—light and fluffy without being overly sweet. For those seeking savory options, the eggs benedict garners high praise as well. The inviting atmosphere, combined with a classic diner vibe enhanced by a nostalgic music playlist, creates a charming setting for dining. Additionally, fresh fruit toppings on the waffles add a touch of brightness to the sweet offerings. With excellent service and a welcoming ambiance, this restaurant stands out as the perfect place to enjoy a hearty and delicious morning meal.'}"

Another customer reported undercooked wings during their visit, despite the restaurant being nearly empty, highlighting the need for better cooking practices and temperature checks. While the staff is friendly and service is generally quick, some diners have mentioned the restaurant's cleanliness as a concern.

The brisket sandwich is a standout, praised for its perfect smokiness and juicy texture, often enjoyed with a flavorful sweet and spicy BBQ sauce on the side. However, some patrons found the pork rib sandwich to be dry with a basic bun and unseasoned fries, leaving them craving more flavor. The Junior pig platter is another popular choice, ideal for sharing but noted for the lack of service since customers often feel self-sufficient. The cornbread and beans received mixed reviews, with the cornbread being described as dry and the beans lacking pork, which may not appeal to everyone. Diners appreciate the friendly staff and the vibrant atmosphere, enhanced by good music and cold beer options.

However, concerns regarding food safety arose when a customer discovered an undercooked tender.

The main attraction is their ramen, featuring options like Spicy Beef, Spicy Chicken, and Spicy Veg; many reviewers prefer the Spicy Beef and Veg for their robust flavors, while the Spicy Chicken is seen as less impactful. The pork donburi also received mixed feedback, praised for its generous portion but critiqued for being overly mayonnaise-heavy despite the well-cooked pork. For dessert, diners enjoyed Green Tea Ice Cream and Mango and Sesame Cheesecake, which added a sweet finish to the meal. The ambiance on weekdays is calm and relaxing, making it a nice spot to unwind. Guests appreciated the unique offerings, including gluten-free potato noodles for those with dietary restrictions. A particularly favorite dish is the Spicy Vegetable ramen, celebrated for its healing properties when feeling under the weather. Overall, the restaurant has garnered positive feedback for its flavors and service, making it a recommended choice for both novice and experienced ramen enthusiasts.',\n",

The Pad See Ew, while cooked to order, suffers from being soggy and too sweet, missing the authentic smoky flavor.

Known for its fantastic value, the meals are generously portioned and freshly prepared in an open kitchen, making it a cozy choice for breakfast and brunch. Guests rave about the perfect over-easy eggs, delectable home fries, and succulent sausage, all complemented by some of the best pancakes they’ve ever tasted—light and fluffy without being overly sweet. For those seeking savory options, the eggs benedict garners high praise as well. The inviting atmosphere, combined with a classic diner vibe enhanced by a nostalgic music playlist, creates a charming setting for dining. Additionally, fresh fruit toppings on the waffles add a touch of brightness to the sweet offerings. With excellent service and a welcoming ambiance, this restaurant stands out as the perfect place to enjoy a hearty and delicious morning meal.'}"
