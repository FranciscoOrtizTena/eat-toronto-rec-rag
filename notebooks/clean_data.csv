While many diners appreciate the freshness of the ingredients and the tasty sauces, there is a general consensus that the protein portions leave something to be desired, especially in dishes like the Pangoa with chicken, where the chicken was described as oddly mushy. Some patrons have highlighted concerns about the misleading pricing of daily deals, noting that the base price often excludes protein, adding extra costs. Despite these criticisms, the salads, especially the large portion sizes, and the delicious sauces make for enjoyable meals, with one customer claiming it was the best salad bowl they've ever had. Fast service and friendly staff are also commendable aspects of this location, although the limited seating can be a drawback. Overall, Freshii provides healthy, crave-worthy options at reasonable prices, making it a recommendable spot for a wholesome breakfast, brunch, or dinner. Patrons also suggest trying the $1 coffee, noted as delicious and a great addition to any meal."

Customers have expressed disappointment over the spring rolls, describing them as being overly starchy, filled with 90% taro and very little meat, resulting in a lack of flavor. Some found the banh mi, like the Komi house style, to be good but noted that the pickled carrots lacked refreshment and that the meat was somewhat dry, with many feeling that the prices were too high for the quality offered. While there were complaints about cold sausage and stale fries in the Sausage & Egg sandwich, other diners enjoyed dishes such as Honey Garlic Chicken and Teriyaki Pineapple Chicken sandwiches, praising their immense flavor and tasty sauce. The beef and chicken banh mi received positive feedback for their crunchy and airy bread, as well as a good meat-to-price ratio. However, the inconsistency in food quality and pricing seems to be a common theme across the reviews. Despite the criticisms, some patrons highlighted the iced Vietnamese coffee with salted milk foam as a redeeming feature of the dining experience. Overall, while there are standout items, many customers remain cautious about returning due to mixed experiences."

However, many diners found the food to be bland, lacking the robust flavors expected from Vietnamese cuisine. For dinner, some enjoyed the Pho Dac Biet, although it was noted to lack depth and aromatic elements like lemongrass and ginger compared to another location. Lunch options included fresh salad rolls and well-done beef pho, but the rice noodles were described as overdone. Additionally, the peanut sauce served with the rolls was overly thick, resembling peanut butter instead of a traditional, smoother consistency. Diners appreciated the light, authentic flavors in the broth but were disappointed at the absence of ingredients commonly found in dishes like Pho Hanoi and Bun Bo Hue, such as onions and pork trotters. While the menu is simple and limited, some customers would still choose to return, citing it as a decent option for Vietnamese food on the east side of downtown. Overall, while the restaurant has potential, many agree that there are better alternatives in the area."
